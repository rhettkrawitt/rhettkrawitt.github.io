    <h2>Head Coach Dan Brandt</h2>

    <p>
        Dan Brandt is an incredible coach and sailor. He has experience 
        coaching a wide range of boats, including 29ers, Laser 2s, 
        FJs, C420s, RS21s, and countless others. He also has lots of 
        experience sailing, owning his wooden keelboat, and sailing on 
        anything from lasers to Aussie 18s.
    </p>
    <p>
        Dan has been coaching the Redwood Sailing Team for 2 years and is 
        also the coach for many of the team's club sailors. He has worked 
        tirelessly to help the Redwood Sailing Team become what it is today, 
        and we are grateful for all his work.

    <h2>Assistant Coach Melissa Purdy</h2>

    <p>
        Melissa Purdy is a former Olympian and mother of another sailor on 
        the team. She has proved invaluable to the team in her first season, 
        coaching during practices and providing free coaching for many local 
        regattas. Without her continual support, the team would not have seen 
        the success it saw at the local NorCal regattas this season.
