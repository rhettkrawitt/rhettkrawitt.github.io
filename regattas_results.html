    <h3>Latest Event - <span class="regatta">Phebe Corckran King Memorial Trophy</span></h3>
    <p>A 5 person team made up of skippers <span class="skipper">Morgan 
    Headington</span>, <span class="skipper">Mark Xu</span>, and 
    <span class="skipper">Rhett Krawitt</span> along with crews 
    <span class="crew skipper">Akira Bratti</span> and <span class="crew skipper">Henry Vare</span> 
    traveled with <span class="coach">Coach Dan Brandt</span> to Annapolis. They competed in a National
    Invitational regatta sailed in both CFJs and C420s. Although they struggled
    at times with the heat, humidity, and long days, the team put up solid results 
    and finished the weekend in 6th out of 18 teams from across the East Coast, 
    Midwest, and West Coast. Off the water the team visited the Naval academy
    there in Annapolis, Maryland and went to a team dinner while keeping 
    immaculate vibes. All in all a very fun regatta.</p>
